To-Do List project is an application built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list. Let us see what is there in the application:
We can add the tasks that are to be done in a descriptive way.
We will be able to add as many tasks as we have.
Once the task is completed, we can remove it by clicking on the “Task Completed” button. When this button is clicked the record is deleted from the database table.
 
Following are the user interface components that will be shown in our application-
1. There will be an add task button , when clicked the task will get stored in our database table as a record(row).
2. There will be a button “Done” for each task added, so we will be able to delete it.
3. The tasks that will be added by the users are stored in the list view and in the database schema, that is , the database table.
